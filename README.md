## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This project uses two datasets from Kaggle:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Student Stress Monitoring Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdsultanulislamovi/student-stress-monitoring-datasets)

- **Stress_Dataset.csv** â†’ Contains lifestyle, academic, and health-related features.  
- **StressLevelDataset.csv** â†’ Provides target labels for stress level classification.  

### Dataset Size
- **X (features):** Input variables such as sleep quality, blood pressure, study load, etc.  
- **y (target):** Stress level (0 = Low, 1 = Moderate, 2 = High).

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- **Decision Tree** achieved the **highest accuracy** (~0.884).  
- **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** also performed competitively.  
- Important predictors included **blood pressure, sleep quality, bullying, future career concerns, and anxiety level**.
